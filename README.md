GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup
Objective
The goal of this project is to implement a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Node.js application. This ensures that the code is automatically tested, built, and deployed when changes are made to the main branch or pull requests are created.

Project Overview
This project integrates Node.js with GitHub Actions to automate:

Building and Testing: The project is automatically tested and built every time code changes are pushed to the main branch or a pull request is created.
Workflow Monitoring: You can track the status of the workflows through the Actions tab on GitHub.
Deployment: If required, the application can be deployed as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Requirements
Before setting up the GitHub Actions workflow, ensure that the following are in place:

Node.js (version 14.x or 16.x) installed locally.
GitHub repository created and Actions enabled.
Automated test framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) defined in package.json.
Key Features and Components
CI (Continuous Integration)
The project runs automated tests on each code push or pull request.
It ensures that the code works across multiple versions of Node.js (14.x and 16.x).
GitHub Actions is used to trigger the workflow, defined in the .github/workflows/node.js.yml file.
Node.js Setup
The project uses Node.js as the runtime environment, and dependencies are installed and managed using npm.
Automated Testing
The pipeline runs automated tests using npm test. You can define your test framework (like Jest or Mocha) in the package.json.
Build Automation
If a build script is defined, the workflow automatically runs npm run build, ensuring that the latest code is built before deployment.
How to Monitor the CI/CD Workflow
After pushing code to the repository, navigate to the Actions tab on GitHub to check the status of your workflows.
Workflow runs will show statuses like Success or Failure, and you can drill down to view detailed logs.
